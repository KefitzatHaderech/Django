# Database Setup

In this tutorial, we will set up the database for our Django application, focusing on using models to represent the data we want to store within our Asia Tours Agency application. We will go through creating a project, setting up an application, defining models, and applying migrations.

## Step 1: Project and Virtual Environment Setup

### Create and Activate Virtual Environment

1. Create a new directory for the project:

    ```bash
    mkdir lesson3_migrate_sqlite3
    cd lesson3_migrate_sqlite3
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

### Install Django

Install Django in your virtual environment:

```bash
pip install django
```

### Create Django Project

Create a new Django project named `worldtour`:

```bash
django-admin startproject worldtour
cd worldtour
```

### Create Django Application

Within the `worldtour` project directory, create a new Django application named `asiatoursagency`:

```bash
python manage.py startapp asiatoursagency
```

## Step 2: Define Models

Models in Django provide a structured way to define the fields and behaviors of the data you want to store in your database.

### Edit `models.py`

In the `asiatoursagency` application, open `models.py` and define the `Tour` model:

```python
from django.db import models

class Tour(models.Model):
    origin_country = models.CharField(max_length=64)
    destination_country = models.CharField(max_length=64)
    number_of_nights = models.IntegerField()
    price = models.IntegerField()

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.origin_country} to {self.destination_country} for {self.number_of_nights} nights at ${self.price}"
```

### Explanation:

- `origin_country`: A character field to store the origin country, with a maximum length of 64 characters.
- `destination_country`: A character field to store the destination country, also with a maximum length of 64 characters.
- `number_of_nights`: An integer field to store the number of nights for the tour.
- `price`: An integer field to store the price of the tour.

## Step 3: Register the Application

To make Django aware of the `asiatoursagency` application, you need to add it to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list in the `worldtour/settings.py` file:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'asiatoursagency',
]
```

## Step 4: Make and Apply Migrations

Migrations are Djangoâ€™s way of propagating changes you make to your models into your database schema. They ensure your database schema is up-to-date with your model definitions.

### Make Migrations

Generate migration files for your model changes:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
```

### Apply Migrations

Apply the generated migrations to your database:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

## Step 5: Interact with the Database

You can now interact with your database using the Django shell.

### Access Django Shell

Open the Django shell with the following command:

```bash
python manage.py shell
```

### Create a Tour Object

Within the Django shell, create a new `Tour` object and save it to the database:

```python
from asiatoursagency.models import Tour

tour1 = Tour(
    origin_country="Japan",
    destination_country="China",
    number_of_nights=7,
    price=1500
)
tour1.save()
```

### Query the Database

You can query the database to retrieve `Tour` objects:

```python
# Get all tours
all_tours = Tour.objects.all()
for tour in all_tours:
    print(tour)

# Filter tours by destination country
china_tours = Tour.objects.filter(destination_country="China")
for tour in china_tours:
    print(tour)
```

## Database Configuration

By default, Django uses SQLite as its database engine. This is configured in the `worldtour/settings.py` file:

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
        'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
    }
}
```

### Using a Different Database

If you want to use a different database (e.g., PostgreSQL), you need to update the `DATABASES` setting in `worldtour/settings.py`:

```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'your_db_name',
        'USER': 'your_db_user',
        'PASSWORD': 'your_db_password',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '5432',
    }
}
```

Ensure you have the necessary database driver installed. For PostgreSQL, you would need `psycopg2`:

```bash
pip install psycopg2-binary
```

## Step 6: Migration Files Overview

When you make migrations, Django generates migration files that describe the changes to your database schema. These files are located in the `migrations` directory of your application.

### Understanding Migration Files

Here is an example of a generated migration file:

```python
# Generated by Django on YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM

from django.db import migrations, models

class Migration(migrations.Migration):

    initial = True

    dependencies = []

    operations = [
        migrations.CreateModel(
            name='Tour',
            fields=[
                ('id', models.AutoField(auto_created=True, primary_key=True, serialize=False, verbose_name='ID')),
                ('origin_country', models.CharField(max_length=64)),
                ('destination_country', models.CharField(max_length=64)),
                ('number_of_nights', models.IntegerField()),
                ('price', models.IntegerField()),
            ],
        ),
    ]
```

### Explanation:

- `initial = True`: Indicates this is the first migration for the `Tour` model.
- `dependencies = []`: Specifies dependencies on other migrations.
- `operations = [migrations.CreateModel(...)]`: Describes the creation of the `Tour` model with its fields.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have set up the database for our Django application, created models, and applied migrations. We also explored how to interact with the database using Django's ORM. 

In the next part, we will explore how to interact with this database directly through Django shell and add tour records. Additionally, we will discuss the database configurations in `settings.py` and how to switch to different database management systems.

Make sure to commit your changes and keep your project structure organized as you progress through your Django development journey.
