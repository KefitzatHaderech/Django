# Django Basics

In this tutorial, we will create a new Django project to build an Asian tours agency management system. This application will help manage tours, destinations, and bookings across Asia. 

## Setting Up the Project

### Step 1: Create Project Directory

First, navigate to the directory where you want to create your project. Open your terminal and use the `cd` command:

```sh
cd path/to/your/desired/directory
```

### Step 2: Activate Virtual Environment

Activating a virtual environment ensures that dependencies are isolated. Use the following command to activate your virtual environment:

```sh
pipenv shell
```

If you haven't created a virtual environment yet, you can do so by running:

```sh
pipenv --python 3.8  # Replace 3.8 with your desired Python version
```

### Step 3: Install Django

With your virtual environment activated, install Django:

```sh
pipenv install django
```

### Step 4: Create Django Project

Create a new Django project named `WorldTour`:

```sh
django-admin startproject WorldTour
```

Navigate into the project directory:

```sh
cd WorldTour
```

### Step 5: Create Django Application

Inside your project, create a new application named `AsiaToursAgency`:

```sh
python manage.py startapp AsiaToursAgency
```

## Understanding Project Structure

Your project directory should now look like this:

```
WorldTour/
    manage.py
    WorldTour/
        __init__.py
        settings.py
        urls.py
        wsgi.py
    AsiaToursAgency/
        __init__.py
        admin.py
        apps.py
        models.py
        tests.py
        views.py
        migrations/
```

### Key Files and Directories

1. **`manage.py`**: A command-line utility that lets you interact with your project.
2. **`settings.py`**: Contains all project settings.
3. **`urls.py`**: Defines URL patterns for the project.
4. **`apps.py`**: Configuration file for the `AsiaToursAgency` app.
5. **`models.py`**: Defines the data models.
6. **`views.py`**: Handles the request/response logic.
7. **`admin.py`**: Configuration for the Django admin interface.
8. **`migrations/`**: Contains database migrations.

## Configuring the Application

### Step 1: Register the Application

Open `WorldTour/settings.py` and add `AsiaToursAgency` to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'AsiaToursAgency.apps.AsiaToursAgencyConfig',
]
```

### Step 2: Define a Simple View

In `AsiaToursAgency/views.py`, create a simple view:

```python
from django.http import HttpResponse

def index(request):
    return HttpResponse("Asia Tours Agency")
```

### Step 3: Create URL Configuration

Create a `urls.py` file inside `AsiaToursAgency` directory:

```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.index, name='index'),
]
```

### Step 4: Include Application URLs

Modify `WorldTour/urls.py` to include the URLs of `AsiaToursAgency`:

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('asiatours/', include('AsiaToursAgency.urls')),
]
```

## Running the Server

### Step 1: Start the Development Server

Ensure you are in the project root directory where `manage.py` is located. Start the server:

```sh
python manage.py runserver
```

### Step 2: Access the Application

Open a web browser and navigate to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/asiatours/
```

You should see "Asia Tours Agency" displayed.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we created a Django project and an application within it. We set up the necessary configurations and created a simple view to ensure everything is working correctly. In the next tutorial, we will dive deeper into models, databases, and migrations to expand our agency's functionality.
