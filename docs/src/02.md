# Setup & Installation

This tutorial will guide you through the installation and initial setup of Django, a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. We will cover installing Python, setting up a virtual environment, installing Django, and creating your first Django project.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1. A computer running Microsoft Windows (this tutorial is Windows-specific).
2. Administrative access to install software.

## 1. Installing Python

### Step 1: Download Python

- Visit the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Click on the "Download Python" button. The latest version available will be Python 3.x.x.

### Step 2: Install Python

- Run the downloaded installer.
- Ensure to check the box "Add Python to PATH" before proceeding.
- Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

### Step 3: Verify Python Installation

Open Command Prompt and type:

```sh
python --version
```

You should see the Python version installed, for example, `Python 3.10.4`.

### Step 4: Verify Pip Installation

Pip is the package installer for Python. Verify its installation:

```sh
pip --version
```

You should see a response like `pip 24.0 from <python-installation-directory>`.

## 2. Installing Django

### Step 1: Install Django

We will use `pip` to install Django. Open Command Prompt and run:

```sh
pip install django
```

This will install the latest version of Django available.

### Step 2: Verify Django Installation

To confirm that Django is installed, run:

```sh
django-admin --version
```

You should see the installed Django version, such as `5.0.4`.

## 3. Setting Up a Virtual Environment

Using a virtual environment is a best practice as it isolates your project dependencies from the global Python installation.

### Step 1: Install `virtualenv`

If you donâ€™t have `virtualenv` installed, you can install it using pip:

```sh
pip install virtualenv
```

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment

Navigate to your project directory and create a virtual environment:

```sh
mkdir my_project
cd my_project
python -m venv venv
```

### Step 3: Activate the Virtual Environment

Activate the virtual environment using:

```sh
venv\Scripts\activate
```

You should see `(venv)` preceding your command prompt.

## 4. Installing Django in the Virtual Environment

With the virtual environment activated, install Django:

```sh
pip install django
```

Verify the installation again:

```sh
django-admin --version
```

## 5. Creating a Django Project

### Step 1: Create a New Django Project

Run the following command to create a new Django project:

```sh
django-admin startproject my_project
```

This will create a `my_project` directory with the following structure:

```
my_project/
    manage.py
    my_project/
        __init__.py
        settings.py
        urls.py
        wsgi.py
        asgi.py
```

### Step 2: Understanding the Project Structure

- `manage.py`: A command-line utility that lets you interact with this Django project.
- `my_project/__init__.py`: An empty file that tells Python this directory should be considered a Python package.
- `my_project/settings.py`: Configuration for this Django project.
- `my_project/urls.py`: The URL declarations for this Django project.
- `my_project/wsgi.py`: An entry-point for WSGI-compatible web servers to serve your project.
- `my_project/asgi.py`: An entry-point for ASGI-compatible web servers to serve your project.

### Step 3: Running the Development Server

Navigate to your project directory and run the development server:

```sh
cd my_project
python manage.py runserver
```

You should see output indicating the server is running:

```
Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

Open a web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. You should see the Django welcome page.

## 6. Creating a Django Application

### Step 1: Create an Application

Within your project, create an application. Applications are the core components of a Django project and allow you to split your project into manageable parts:

```sh
python manage.py startapp my_app
```

This creates a directory `my_app` with the following structure:

```
my_app/
    __init__.py
    admin.py
    apps.py
    models.py
    tests.py
    views.py
    migrations/
```

### Step 2: Register the Application

To include your application in your project, add it to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list in `my_project/settings.py`:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'my_app',
]
```

## 7. Running the Development Server Again

Run the development server again to ensure everything is set up correctly:

```sh
python manage.py runserver
```

Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to see your project running.

## Conclusion

You have successfully installed Python and Django, set up a virtual environment, created a new Django project, and created a Django application. This foundation will enable you to start developing web applications using Django. In the next tutorial, we will dive deeper into creating views, templates, and handling URLs.
