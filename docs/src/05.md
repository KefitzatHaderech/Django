# Adding Database Records

In this tutorial, we will focus on adding records to the database in Django. We will use the Django shell, which provides an interface for interacting directly with our Django project's database. This allows us to create, read, update, and delete records with ease. The Django shell is an essential tool for testing and managing your database.

## Setting Up the Django Shell

### Step 1: Open the Django Shell

First, ensure that your virtual environment is activated. Then, you can open the Django shell by running the following command:

```bash
python manage.py shell
```

This command opens an interactive shell specifically tied to your Django project.

### Step 2: Importing Models

Within the shell, you can import your models. For this tutorial, we will assume you have a model named `Tour` in an app called `AsiaTours`.

```python
from asia_tours.models import Tour
```

## Creating Records

### Step 3: Creating an Instance of a Model

You can create a new instance of the `Tour` model by assigning values to its attributes. Let's create a tour with specific details:

```python
tour1 = Tour(origin_country='Japan', destination_country='China', number_of_nights=10, price=1500)
```

### Step 4: Saving the Record to the Database

After creating the instance, you need to save it to the database:

```python
tour1.save()
```

By calling the `save()` method, Django writes the record to the database.

### Step 5: Accessing Attributes of the Record

You can access the attributes of the saved record to verify the values:

```python
print(tour1.origin_country)  # Output: Japan
print(tour1.destination_country)  # Output: China
print(tour1.number_of_nights)  # Output: 10
print(tour1.price)  # Output: 1500
```

### Step 6: Implementing a String Representation

To improve the readability of your model instances, you can define a `__str__` method in the `Tour` model. This method returns a human-readable string representation of the model instance.

Edit your `Tour` model as follows:

```python
class Tour(models.Model):
    origin_country = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    destination_country = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    number_of_nights = models.IntegerField()
    price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)

    def __str__(self):
        return f'Tour {self.id}: {self.origin_country} to {self.destination_country}, {self.number_of_nights} nights, ${self.price}'
```

### Step 7: Exiting and Re-entering the Shell

To apply the changes to your model, exit the shell and then re-enter it:

```bash
exit()
python manage.py shell
```

### Step 8: Re-importing and Creating Another Record

Re-import the `Tour` model and create another record:

```python
from asia_tours.models import Tour

tour2 = Tour(origin_country='Vietnam', destination_country='South Korea', number_of_nights=15, price=2500)
tour2.save()

print(tour2)  # Output: Tour 2: Vietnam to South Korea, 15 nights, $2500
```

### Conclusion

In this tutorial, you have learned how to use the Django shell to add records to your database. You created instances of the `Tour` model, saved them to the database, and implemented a string representation for better readability. This process is crucial for managing your database records effectively and testing your Django application.

In the next tutorial, we will cover how to render these records on a web page. Stay tuned for more advanced Django techniques.
