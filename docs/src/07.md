# Admin Dashboard

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will explore the Django admin dashboard, an essential feature that allows administrators to manage data in a user-friendly way. This tutorial will cover creating a superuser, registering models, and utilizing the admin interface to add and edit data. The Django admin is a powerful tool for backend developers to efficiently manage application data without manually interacting with the database through command-line interfaces.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with this tutorial, ensure you have the following:
- A basic understanding of Django and Python.
- A Django project set up and running.
- Familiarity with Django models and the Django ORM.

## Step 1: Creating a Superuser

To access the Django admin dashboard, we first need to create a superuser. A superuser is a user with all permissions granted, allowing them to manage the entire site.

Open your terminal and navigate to your Django project directory. Run the following command to create a superuser:

```sh
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

You will be prompted to enter a username, email address, and password. For demonstration purposes, you can use the following credentials (but ensure to use a strong password in production):

```
Username: admin
Email: admin@example.com
Password: admin123
```

## Step 2: Registering Models in Admin

Next, we need to register our models with the Django admin site. This allows the models to be managed through the admin interface.

Consider a simple model for a tour agency application:

```python
# models.py

from django.db import models

class Tour(models.Model):
    origin_country = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    destination_country = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    number_of_nights = models.PositiveIntegerField()
    price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.origin_country} to {self.destination_country} - {self.number_of_nights} nights"
```

To register this model, create or update the `admin.py` file in your application directory:

```python
# admin.py

from django.contrib import admin
from .models import Tour

admin.site.register(Tour)
```

## Step 3: Accessing the Admin Dashboard

Start the Django development server by running:

```sh
python manage.py runserver
```

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/`. You will be prompted to log in with the superuser credentials you created earlier.

Once logged in, you will see the Django administration dashboard. The `Tour` model will be listed under your application name.

## Step 4: Adding and Editing Data

In the Django admin dashboard, you can add and edit data for your models. Follow these steps:

1. Click on the `Tours` link in the admin interface.
2. Click the "Add tour" button to create a new tour entry.
3. Fill in the form with the required details:
   - Origin Country: South Korea
   - Destination Country: China
   - Number of Nights: 7
   - Price: 2500.00
4. Click "Save" to add the tour.

You can also edit existing tours by clicking on the tour entry and modifying the fields. Changes can be saved by clicking the "Save" button again.

## Step 5: Managing Users and Permissions

The Django admin interface also allows you to manage users and their permissions. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

1. Click on the `Users` link in the admin interface.
2. Click the "Add user" button to create a new user.
3. Fill in the required details and set a strong password.
4. In the user edit form, you can assign the user to groups and set specific permissions.
5. To grant a user access to the admin site, ensure the "Staff status" checkbox is selected.

For instance, to create a new user named Nancy with admin access:
- Username: Nancy
- Password: Nano$123

Ensure "Staff status" is checked to allow Nancy to log in to the admin site.

## Conclusion

The Django admin dashboard is a powerful feature that allows efficient management of application data. By creating a superuser, registering models, and utilizing the admin interface, administrators can easily add, edit, and manage data without directly interacting with the database through command-line tools.

This concludes our tutorial on the Django admin dashboard. We encourage you to explore the various features and customization options available in the Django admin to enhance your application's data management capabilities.
