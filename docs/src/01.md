# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will explore the Django web framework, beginning with foundational concepts and progressively advancing towards more complex topics. By the end of this tutorial series, you will have built a real-life application: an inventory management system. This project will provide hands-on experience with Django, including function-based views and clean, simple styles.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into Django, it's essential to have a good understanding of Python. Intermediate proficiency in Python will help you follow along more easily. Familiarity with HTML and CSS will also be beneficial. If you need to brush up on these technologies, consider reviewing relevant courses or tutorials.

## What is Django?

Django is a high-level Python web framework designed to facilitate rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It is often referred to as a "batteries-included" framework because it comes with a wide array of built-in features, such as:

- Django Admin interface
- Default database management system (SQLite3)
- Extensive collection of additional packages

These built-in features streamline the web development process, making Django a powerful tool for building robust web applications.

## Why Use Django?

### Rapid Development

Django allows for the creation of fully-fledged web applications in a short amount of time. Its design philosophy emphasizes reusable components and rapid prototyping.

### Database Flexibility

While SQLite3 is the default database, Django supports easy switching to other databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLAlchemy.

### Built-in Admin Interface

Django includes an admin interface that simplifies administrative tasks related to website management.

### Extensive Ecosystem

Django has a vast collection of additional packages that extend its functionality, facilitating rapid development.

## Django's MVT Architecture

Django follows the Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture, which separates the logic of your application into three distinct components:

1. **Model**: Represents the data structure of your application, essentially defining the schema of your database tables and encapsulating the logic for interacting with the database.

2. **View**: A Python function or class that receives HTTP requests and returns HTTP responses. Views process incoming requests, interact with the database through models, and prepare data to be rendered in a response.

3. **Template**: HTML files that contain the structure of your application's user interface. Templates can include placeholders and template tags, which are replaced with dynamic content when rendered by Django.

### How MVT Works

1. **User Interaction**: The user interacts with the Django application by sending HTTP requests to specific URLs. These requests can be for various actions such as viewing a page, submitting a form, or performing some other operation.

2. **View Processing**: The view function or class processes the request, interacts with the database, and prepares data to be rendered in the response.

3. **Model Interaction**: The view interacts with the model to fetch data from the database using Django's Object-Relational Mapping (ORM). Instead of writing SQL queries directly, you define your database structure using Python classes (models).

4. **Data Rendering**: After processing the request and interacting with the database, the view passes data to a template using the Django template language. The template uses template tags and placeholders to dynamically generate HTML content.

5. **HTTP Response**: The view returns an HTTP response containing the HTML content generated by the template. This response is sent back to the user's browser, which then renders the page and displays it to the user.

## Setting Up the Environment

In the next section, we will set up our environment, install Django, and create our first Django project.

## Code Snippets

### Installing Django

First, ensure you have Python installed. You can check this by running:

```bash
python --version
```

To install Django, use pip:

```bash
pip install django
```

### Creating a Django Project

To create a new Django project, run the following command:

```bash
django-admin startproject myproject
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd myproject
```

### Running the Development Server

Start the development server to verify the installation:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

You should see output indicating that the server is running, and you can access it by navigating to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your web browser.

### Creating an App

In Django, an application is a component of your project that performs specific functions. To create an app, run:

```bash
python manage.py startapp inventory
```

### Defining a Model

Define a model for your inventory management system in `inventory/models.py`:

```python
from django.db import models

class Product(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    sku = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
    quantity = models.IntegerField()
    supplier = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    
    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
```

### Creating and Applying Migrations

To create the necessary database tables, run:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

### Registering the Model in Admin

Register your model in `inventory/admin.py` to make it accessible through the Django admin interface:

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import Product

admin.site.register(Product)
```

### Creating a Superuser

Create a superuser to access the admin interface:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Follow the prompts to set up the superuser account.

### Accessing the Admin Interface

Start the development server if it's not already running:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` and log in with your superuser credentials. You should see your `Product` model listed.

## Conclusion

This tutorial has introduced you to the Django web framework, covering its fundamental concepts and architecture. By following the steps provided, you have set up a Django project, created an application, defined a model, and registered it with the admin interface. In subsequent tutorials, we will delve deeper into Django's features and build a fully functional inventory management system.
